# 📌 AUTONOMOUS LOGIC LANE CAR USING STM32  

This repository contains the firmware for an **autonomous robot** that moves **between two lines** (a "logic lane") using IR sensors and incorporates **color detection** using an RGB color sensor. The robot is programmed to stay within the boundaries of the two lines and perform specific actions (e.g., stopping or making a U-turn) when it detects certain colors.
